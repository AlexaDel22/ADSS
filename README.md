# AGRARIAN – Agricultural Decision Support Platform

## Overview

**AGRARIAN** is an integrated digital platform that supports decision-making in real agricultural environments across **arable crops, viticulture, and livestock management**. Built around an **Agricultural Decision Support System (ADSS)**, the platform brings together data from **in-field sensors, open weather sources, and drone-based monitoring** into a single, practical interface.

AGRARIAN addresses a core challenge in agriculture: data is often fragmented across multiple tools, while decisions must be taken quickly under changing field and weather conditions. By unifying **monitoring, forecasting, simulations, and alerts**, AGRARIAN helps users understand current conditions, anticipate risks, and act with confidence.

## What It Does

* **Centralized monitoring** of sensor data with historical trends and dashboards
* **Weather forecast integration** from open data sources for short- and mid-term planning
* **Scenario-based simulations and alerts** supporting operational decisions
* **Drone integration** for livestock supervision and event detection (where applicable)

All data is synchronized, quality-checked, and stored in a common data layer to ensure reliability and traceability.

## Pilots

AGRARIAN is validated through three real-world pilots:

* **Arable Crops:** sensor monitoring, weather forecasts, and decision-support simulations
* **Zootechnics:** drone-based supervision of sheep and goats with detection and alerts
* **Viticulture:** vineyard monitoring and grape maturity/sweetness forecasting

Each pilot validates the same scalable ADSS backbone while addressing different agricultural use cases.

## Key Technical Highlights

* **Modular & scalable architecture** – easy integration of new sensors, data sources, and models
* **Reliable data handling** – synchronization, quality checks, and historical records
* **Role-based access control** – aligned with operational responsibilities
* **Interoperability** – standard formats and APIs for external integrations
* **Decision traceability** – past data, forecasts, and simulations remain accessible

## Status

AGRARIAN is under active development and pilot validation, designed to grow into a flexible decision-support platform for modern agriculture.
